Task
Imagine that there is a row of one hundred doors. Your program should set up the initial states and proceed as follows:

There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed.
You make 100 passes by the doors:
The first time through, you visit every door and toggle its state (if the door is closed, you open it; if it is open, you close it).
The second time, you only visit every 2nd door (door #2, #4, #6, …), and toggle it.
The third time, you visit every 3rd door (door #3, #6, #9, …).
Continue this pattern until you only visit the 100th door.
Print out the numbers of the doors that are open - if your program works correctly you should see a pattern.
Can you describe the sequence of numbers that your program has created?
